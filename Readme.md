# Keylogger with Remote Log Transfer

## Overview

This project implements a keylogger using Python and the `pynput` library, which captures keystrokes on a target machine and periodically sends the log data to a remote server via TCP. A corresponding bash script is used on the server to listen for incoming connections and store the logs in a text file.

### Features:
- Captures and logs keystrokes on the target machine.
- Periodically sends the logged data to a remote server.
- The listener script on the server saves received data into a log file.
- The Python script is converted into an executable using PyInstaller.

## Keylogger Details

### 1. Keylogger Definition

A **keylogger** is a program that captures and records every keystroke made on a target computer or device. This type of software can be used for legitimate purposes such as monitoring employee activity or malicious purposes such as stealing sensitive information.

### 2. Advantages of Keyloggers
- **Monitoring**: Useful for monitoring user activity on a system.
- **Security auditing**: Can be used to analyze suspicious behavior or unauthorized access.
- **Data recovery**: Captures keystrokes which may help recover lost information.

### 3. Disadvantages of Keyloggers
- **Privacy invasion**: Keyloggers can infringe on personal privacy if misused.
- **Malicious intent**: Can be used by attackers to steal passwords, credit card information, and other sensitive data.
- **Undetectable by antivirus**: When crafted carefully, keyloggers can evade antivirus detection, making them dangerous in the wrong hands.

## Keylogger Process

The keylogger operates using the `pynput` library to monitor and record key presses. Every 10 seconds, the recorded keystrokes are sent to a remote server specified by its IP address and port.

#### Key Components:
1. **Key Press Capture** : 
   - Captures each key pressed by the user, including special keys like spacebar and backspace.
   - Logs the key data into a file located in the system's temporary directory (`temp_dir`).
   
2. **Log Sending**:
   - A background thread is started which sends the key logs to a server every 10 seconds using a TCP socket.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Captures any errors that occur during the key logging or file sending process and logs them to a separate log file.

### Bash Listener Script

On the server-side, the bash script listens on a specific port (defined as `6969` in this case) for incoming log data. The received data is appended to a log file.

#### Listener Details:
- Uses `nc` (Netcat) to listen on a port and receive incoming log data.
- New entries are compared to avoid duplicate logging.
- The script waits 10 seconds between each listening cycle.

## Usage

### 1. Setup Keylogger on Target Machine

- Install necessary Python packages:
  ```bash
  pip install pynput
  ```
  
- Modify the `SERVER_IP` in the Python script to the IP address of your server machine.

- Run the Python keylogger:
  ```bash
  python send.py
  ```

### 2. Run Listener Script on Server

- Start the bash listener script:
  ```bash
  bash listen.sh
  ```

- The server will now listen for incoming log data and append it to `log.txt`.

### 3. Convert Python Script to Executable

To make the Python keylogger executable and prevent detection through the console window, use PyInstaller:
```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --name Keylogger send.py
```

This creates an executable file that can be run on a target machine without requiring a Python interpreter. The `--noconsole` flag ensures that the program runs in the background, without a visible console window.

> **Note**: Ensure the proper handling of antivirus software, as keylogger programs may be flagged as malicious.

## Conclusion

This keylogger project demonstrates the basic functionality of a keylogger along with the ability to send logs to a remote server for monitoring. Use this software responsibly and within legal boundaries.
